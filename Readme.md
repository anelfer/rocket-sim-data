_Version 1.12.2_

This project simulates a rocket flight using approximate parameters inspired by SpaceX's **Falcon 9** architecture. The model takes into account basic physical laws, launch phases, engine configurations, and allows control via a REST API. It is suitable for engineering experiments, flight control algorithm testing, and trajectory visualization.

## Visualization

### üìà Flight Trajectory
![Trajectory](images/trajectory.png)

This chart displays the rocket's trajectory over time. It allows you to track ascent phases, orbital insertion, or a failed mission scenario. The model approximates gravity, atmospheric drag, and changing mass during fuel consumption.

## REST API Endpoints

### 1. Start Simulation
- **Endpoint:** `/simulation/start`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Description:** Initializes the rocket launch and starts the simulation process. Sending a POST request begins the trajectory and engine calculations.

### 2. Get Simulation Data
- **Endpoint:** `/simulation/data`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Description:** Retrieves current rocket state data, including altitude, velocity, mass, acceleration, and engine status.

### 3. Get Engines Information
- **Endpoint:** `/engines`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Description:** Returns a list of all engines, their parameters, and current state.

### 4. Update Engine Information
- **Endpoint:** `/engines/{id}`
- **Method:** `PUT`
- **Description:** Updates parameters for a specific engine by ID. You can modify thrust levels, fuel consumption, or operational mode.
